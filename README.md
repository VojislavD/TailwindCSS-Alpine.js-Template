## Usage

primary and secondary colors in tailwind.config.js and you have @tailwindcss/forms plugin installed.

colors you want in all components where those colors are used.

If you want to use customized scrollbar, make sure to configure that also in tailwind.config.js.

Check `tailwind.config.js` file to see how to configure everything properly.
